Project Goals:

Creating a CRUD panel automatically, including search and items edition given only the Class and a Data Provider. It can be integrated with any ORM, like Hibernate, MyBatis, etc or even in memory data (like the example).

TODO List:

1. Adding @LongString annotation for multiple lines of text, with field/property for lines number.
2. Improve the Deep Copy in the clone method.
3. Use this Dialog Class instead.

4. Finding a way to pushing the library as a maven package in S3. Maybe using awss3-maven-wagon

Screenshots (Code can be seen in the Sample Package):
