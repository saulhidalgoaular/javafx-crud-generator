# CRUD Panel Generator for JavaFX

## Project Description
This JavaFX project is designed to automatically create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) panel. By providing only a Class and a Data Provider, you can generate a fully functional CRUD interface. The project supports integration with Java Persistence API (JPA) and any of its implementations, such as Hibernate, MyBatis, or even in-memory data.

## Features
- **Automatic CRUD Panel Generation:** Create a CRUD interface by simply specifying a Class and a Data Provider.
- **Search and Edit Items:** Built-in search functionality and item editing capabilities.

- **In-Memory Data Support:** Supports in-memory data for easy testing and development.
